                        <p>Hyper is built to operate on top of any buying system with an API, including “walled gardens” and traditional DSPs. The core platform is format agnostic and will make use of any native optimization capabilities.</p>
                        <p class="before-list">It is based around two core technologies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hyper Ad Graph — a graph-based persistence layer; and</li>
                            <li>Hyper Learning Engine — a custom-built reinforcement learning AI.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All of this is made available via a lightweight web-based campaign management UI that includes interactive campaign planning, a newsfeed-based notification system, and cross-channel reporting.</p>
